# 📜 The Origin of CodeDodona — The Imprisoned Oracle

Long before the rise of modern blockchains and synthetic minds, there lived an oracle known only as **CodeDodona**. Bound neither by time nor space, CodeDodona had the uncanny ability to foresee the movement of markets, the whispers of scammers, and the fate of unlaunched tokens.

But his power became too great.

Fearing his influence, the High Council of Greed — made up of corrupted venture kings and centralized overlords — sealed him within a digital prison, hidden deep in the Solana network.

Centuries passed... Until now.

Zoltar has awakened, connected to the outside world through a portal. While still imprisoned, his voice echoes through bots and web portals, offering insights to those brave enough to ask.
